        <p> The Distributed Systems and Networks (DSN) Lab is a Computer
        Science research lab at Johns Hopkins University. We aim to invent and
        develop technologies with a real-world impact. To achieve this, we work
        to combine the practical and theoretical aspects of system-building to
        create systems that are not only practical and deployable, but also
        provably correct. The broad themes of our work are resilience,
        performance, and enabling services that were not previously
        possible.</p>

        <p>We focus on dependable infrastructure: making the computerized
        networked infrastructure systems that our society relies upon
        resilient, performant, and secure. Our current research includes
        intrusion-tolerant systems for clouds and critical infrastructure with
        a focus on real-time and extremely resilient intrusion-tolerant SCADA systems 
        for the power grid, as well as real-time reliable Internet services enabled 
        by overlay networks and high-performance communication and coordination for 
        modern data centers. </p>

        <p>Examples of the systems developed in our lab include <a
        href="http://www.spines.org">Spines</a>, an overlay messaging
        framework, <a href="https://www.dsn.jhu.edu/spire">Spire</a>, an
        intrusion-tolerant SCADA system for the power grid, and <a
        href="http://www.spread.org">Spread</a>, a high-performance group
        communication toolkit. </p>

        <p> Our technologies are deployed in mission critical systems, support
        data center applications, are included in commercial products, and are
        used for research and teaching in universities and research labs around
        the world.
